# Course Description
> The emphasis of this class is to learn to envision data genealogically, as assemblages, as part of a dispositif and infrastructure in order to reframe them beyond technological conceptions. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical, political and philosophical aspects of data. During the term we will explore data, facts and truth; the power of data both big and small; governmentality and biopolitics; risk, probability and the taming of chance; algorithmic culture, dynamic nominalism, categorization and ontologies; and the circularity of the transduction and translation of people, space and social phenomena into and by data and software and finally we will discuss the role of data in the production of knowledge.

> This class format is a graduate MA seminar, a collaborative workshop with a Community Partner which is the **_Infrastructure Canada Smart Community Challenge Team_** and this year’s theme is critical data studies and smart cities.

### 1. Weekly Reading Reflections (8 of 12) (30%):

Students are asked to submit weekly reflections where they critically discuss their smart city communities in relation to a weekly question, the readings, thematic readings and thematic encyclopaedia readings. Students are asked to conceptually integrate the material for that week, and to consider these in the context of their communities and are asked to identify concepts that may inform their CDS Research Paper and/or their poster project. The reflection should end with a question for the class.

> The first week of class you will select 2 of 20 [Infrastructure Canada Smart City Challenge submissions](https://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/cities-villes/proposals-propositions-eng.html)

> You will also work with the [call for tender for the Smart Community Challenge](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/smart-cities/challenge) and the [Open Smart City Guide V1.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1528rqTjzKWwk4s2xKuPf7ZJg-tLlRK8WcMZQbicoGTM/edit).

> This **does not** need to be a polished document; you can jot notes in the document during class, you can add sketches, images and/or diagrams and tables. It can be typed or written by hand on any medium of paper of any size!

> Only in class paper submissions are accepted. 

> The objective is to build knowledge on a weekly basis to inform you final CDS Research Paper 


### 2. Data Description and Conceptualization- Due Week 2 8:00 Jan. 15 (10%):

Select a dataset related to this year’s theme of smart cities, and ideally one related to either of your Smart City Challenge Communities. In a total of 3 pages describe these data technically where a technical description generally includes the following, but do not be limited to this: consider format, sample size, headings, metadata, licences and terms of use, how are they disseminated, who is the publisher, the producing institution, data authors if there are any, methodology, dates, geography, classifications, models, methods, etc. Be sure to cite the dataset & provide the URL, cite any related documentation, you can use footnotes, images and tables if useful, but do use full citation, captions and document styles. Get to know these data. 

You will also conceptually frame these data according to **Kitchin's 4 remaining conceptualizations and identify any elements of the socio-technological assemblage**. State why you are interested in this dataset, what these might be used for, and explain what leads you to trust them or not. NOTE: Images, tables and references will not go against your page count. Think of this as a critically informed lab report.

### 3. CDS Research paper and Poster project (10 parts):

Students will demonstrate their familiarity with the course material by applying critical data studies concepts and theories related to this year’s theme of smart cities. For the poster, students are to research and map out the socio-technological data assemblage of a smart city theme or topic or city or community which can be related to one or both of their smart communities or the INFC Impact call for tender or the Open Smart City Guide. The abstract and poster will be submitted and presented at the Data Day 7.0 Conference on March 31 organized by the Carleton Institute for Data Science.

Students will also write a 15-page Critical Data Studies Research Paper that incorporates the readings, their specific smart city communities, the IMPACT call for tender and the Open Smart City V1.0 Guide. When writing this paper, consider INFC as your reader, and your objective is to introduce them to a CDS approach to thinking about and governing smart communities. Images, tables and references do not go against your page count.


#### 3.1 Infrastructure Canada Guest Lecture - Week 3, Jan 22. 

#### 3.2 Smart City Data Assemblage Brainsstorm/Mindmap, Week 4, Jan 29 (5%)
Students can use Mindmap, Coggle.it, or power point or any other tool to draw out/illustrate or model the socio-technological assemblage of the data, processes and technologies discussed by INFC. You can relate this to your communities if you like. We will show these in class on Week 5.

#### 3.3 Poster Project Proposal, Week 5 Feb.5, (5%), 1 page Quad Chart:
1.	Introduce what you will examine
2.	Provide two potential research questions
3.	State your methodological approach and concepts you will examine
4.	References

#### 3.4 DRAFT Poster Project Abstract for peer review Week 7 Feb. 26 (5%):
See CUIDS instructions. 

#### 3.5 Submit Final Poster Abstract to CUIDS (5%)

#### 3.6 Digital Draft of Poster for In-Class Peer Review Week 9 Mar. 11, in class
See CUIDS instructions. Note that a poster as a form of scholarly communication is common in scientific fields, geomatics and engineering. The following are some general instructions to guide the production of your posters but keep in mind that your poster will be somewhat different and you will have to adapt these techniques to critical data studies and your topic. Also, note this is not an infographic, this is a ‘scientific’ poster.  Here are some useful guidelines:
* [NYU Libraries Guide](http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276826&p=1846154)
* [Urbana Champaign Library Guide](http://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347412&p=2343433)
* [10 Simple Rules for a Good Poster Presentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876493/) 

#### 3.7 Submit a draft CDS Research Paper for Peer review Week 10, March 18
Note that your weekly submissions are helping you create content for this research paper.

#### 3.8 Print poster and submit digital copy to culearn Week 12, March 30 (15%)
If your poster is accepted for Data Day 7.0 a printout of your poster will be required and generally there is a cost to this (+/-40$). Should your poster not be accepted a digital copy only is to be submitted. Whether or not your poster is accepted does not affect your mark.

#### 3.9 Attend Data Day 7.0 Poster Session Week 12, March 31

#### 3.10 Submit final CDS Research paper to cuLearn, Week 12 April 1 (20%)
A copy of the paper and poster will also be shared with the Director General of INFS Smart Communities Program and her team.

What is being measured? Does it make sense? Is there anything missing? What contribution have the readings made to your understanding of what is being proposed in your submissions?

## Week 3 (Jan. 22) – Infrastructure Canada Guest Speakers
#### Week 3 - In-Class Indicator Exercise:
> To prepare for our guests, please list a series of questions you might have about the program, about the IMPACT, and your Communities. If you think you might require any additional information for your poster or research paper, this is a good time to inquire.

## Week 4 (Jan.29) – Facts
This week we discuss objectivity and the production of facts and whether it is possible to tell the truth!

#### Week 4 - In-Class Facts Exercise:
> How will your Smart City Challenge submissions ensure that they deliver on their promise? How can the public they aim to serve, and Infrastructure Canada be assured that they will do what they purport to do? How to attest to the trust of their work? How should results be reported? What would you propose? Is there anything in their organizational structure that can help? Are there any ideas from the readings that can improve these submissions? How can they be more transparent? Proactive disclosure?

## Week 5 (Feb. 5) – Categories and Social Sorting
Humans like to make sense of the world by sorting things out into classifications and then measure them with indicators. This week we examine the classic Hacking’s social constructivist view of classifying and how classification is key to infrastructural thinking.

> What kind of administrative data will you communities have to collect? How will these data be linked? Will any group of people be monitored to assess impact? If this was a general smart city project, which administrative or automated systems should they also consider? Is there any form of cost recovery program that should be put in place? Who should own these data? And just want kind of data will your program be collecting? Will any of these data be open data? What kind of ideas might you gain from the readings to help your communities or INFC as it pertains to the collection and procurement of data?

#### In-Class Map Assignment 10%. 
> In the Map, Data and Government Information Centre there is a map display entitled the Evolution of the Communication Infrastructure in Canada with some maps about Aboriginal People in Canada. The maps are organized into groups, you will be assigned a set of maps and will be provided with an in-class assignment. You will be required to consider the Harley paper and the Phillips keynote.

#### Week 8 - In-Class Indigenous Knowledge Exercise:
> You have been assigned 2 challenges for the term, one that is from an Indigenous community and one that is not. While you only have a small sample size, can you identify any qualitative differences between these? Does your submission propose to collect Indigenous knowledge and if so, what kinds of data? Also, based on this week’s readings, and thematic materials such as OCAP principles, what do you think is missing if anything, from the Indigenous submissions? And what could the non-Indigenous submissions gain? Was there any mention of sovereignty or residency? Ownership? Local and traditional knowledge? How might procurement include issues pertaining to Indigenous knowledge? What new data classifications do you think should be rethought? Was there a data governance plan?

#### Week 10 - In-Class Probability and Risk Exercise:
> Is there any kind of predictive analytics, AI/ML systems being proposed in your communities? Your submissions have a risk assessment, do you think this adequately covers any of the risks of predictive systems and AI/ML? Is there an assessment of who might be affected or be the target of these systems? When are these systems routine and when are they affecting humans directly? Is the issue of the black box addressed? Is there any type oversight or governance of these systems? Do you foresee any surveillance and control issues or mission creep with any of these systems? What kind of mechanism should be in place to ensure that the smart city does not become a surveillant city?

#### Week 11 - In-Class infrastructure Exercise:
> Do you think infrastructure in terms of the smart city is merely operational with an efficiency agenda and/or do you think infrastructures are political, cultural, social? Where are these systems currently governed in a city? What role does the public have in shaping these? Are these mentioned in urban plans? Who maintains this infrastructure in the short and long term and how do your smart communities address longevity? Is there a maintenance plan and a replacement plan? How can cities benefit from the ASDI and should they consider SDIs? Do your communities have a Technology Roadmap and how does the smart city fit in?

## Week 12 (Apr. 1) – From Critical Theory to Action
It is the end of term; students have been working very hard! This week student will discuss observations derived from watching two ‘data’ documentaries We will discuss activism and the engaged scholarship your professor has been involved with. And, what is to be done in our datafied worlds!.

#### Week 12 - In-Class Critical Perspectives Exercise:
> Constructive critical thought is difficult, and it takes work. What would be a way to infuse critical perspectives in the governance of smart cities and your communities specifically? We covered quite a bit of ground in the class, what did we miss and what would you add, and what might you recommend to INFC and your communities?
